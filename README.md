# GNU/Linux Rapid Embedded Programming
This is the code repository for [GNU/Linux Rapid Embedded Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/gnulinux-rapid-embedded-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781786461803), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
This book presents popular and user-friendly boards in the industry – such as Beaglebone Black, Atmel Xplained, Wandboard, and system-on-chip manufacturers – and lets you explore corresponding projects that make use of these boards. You will first program the embedded platforms using the C, Bash, and Python/PHP languages in order to get access to the external peripherals. You will gain a strong foundation in using embedded systems by learning how to program the device driver and access the peripherals. You will also learn how to read and write data from/to the external environment by using C programs or a scripting language (such as Bash/PHP/Python) and see how to configure a device driver for specific hardware.

The final chapter shows you how to use a micro-controller board – based on the most used microcontroller – to implement real-time or specific tasks that are normally not carried out on the GNU/Linux system. After finishing this book, you will be capable of applying these skills to your personal and professional projects.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter01

The code will look like the following:
       
       static int ngpios;
       static int gpios[2] = { -1 , -1 };
       module_param_array(gpios, int, &ngpios, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP);
       MODULE_PARM_DESC(gpios, "Defines the GPIOs number to be used as a list of"
                        " numbers separated by commas.");

       /* Logging stuff */
       #define __message(level, fmt, args...)                                  \
                       printk(level "%s: " fmt "\n" , NAME , ## args)

There are no code files for the following chapters:

- **Chapter 01**  - Managing the System Console
- **Chapter 18**  - Pulse-Width Modulation – PWM

### Software requirements:

Regarding the software you should have a little knowledge of a non graphical text editor as
vi, emacs or nano. Even if you can connect an LCD display, a keyboard and a mouse
directly to embedded kits and then use the graphical interface, in this book we assume that
you is able to do little modifications to text files by using a text only editor.
The host computer, that is the computer you will use to cross-compile the code and/or to
manage your embedded systems, is assumed running a GNU/Linux based distribution. My
host PC is running an Ubuntu 15.10 but you can use also a newer Ubuntu Long Term
Support (LTS) or a Debian based system too with little modifications or you may use
another GNU/Linux distribution but with a little effort from you mainly regarding the
cross-compiling tools installation, libraries dependencies and packages management.
Foreign systems such as Windows, MacOS or similar are not covered by this book due the
fact you should not use low technology systems to develop code for high technology
system!
Knowing how a C compiler works and how to manage a Makefile is required.
This book will present some kernel programming techniques but these must cannot be
taken as a kernel programming course. You need a proper book for such topic! However each
example is well documented and you will find several suggested resources. Regarding the
kernel I'd like to state that the version used into this book is 4.4.x.
As a final note I suppose that you known how to connect a GNU/Linux based board on the
Internet in order to download a package or a generic file.

### Hardware requirements:

In this book all code is developed for BeagleBone Black board revision C, for SAMA5D3
Xplained revision A or for the WandBoard revision C1 (depending on the board used) but
you can use an older revision without any issues, in fact the code is portable and it should
work on other systems too (but the DTS files whose must be considered apart)!
Regarding the computer peripherals used in this book I reported in each chapter where I
got the hardware and where you can buy it but, of course, you can decide to surf the
Internet in order to find a better and cheaper offer. A note where to find the datasheet is
also present.
You should not have any difficulties in order to connect the hardware presented in this
book with the embedded kits since the connections are very simple and well documented.
They don't require any particular hardware skills to be performed from you (apart knowing
how to use a solder), however having a minor knowledge in electronics may help.
